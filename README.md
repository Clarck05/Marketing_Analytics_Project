## **Business Problem**

ShopEasy, an online retail business, has experienced a decline in customer engagement and conversion rates despite significant investments in new marketing campaigns. The marketing and customer experience teams are seeking a comprehensive data analysis to understand campaign effectiveness, customer pain points, and strategic opportunities for improvement.

**Key Challenges:**
- **Reduced Customer Engagement:** A noticeable drop in customer interactions with the website and marketing content.
- **Decreased Conversion Rates:** Fewer website visitors are making purchases.
- **Inefficient Marketing Spend:** High marketing expenses are not generating the expected return on investment.
- **Need for Feedback Analysis:** A necessity to analyze customer reviews to improve products and services.

## **Project Goals**

The primary goals of this analysis were defined to address the key business challenges:

- **Increase Conversion Rates:** Identify factors impacting conversion rates and recommend strategies to optimize the sales funnel.
- **Enhance Customer Engagement:** Determine which content types drive the most interaction to inform and improve content strategy.
- **Improve Customer Feedback Scores:** Analyze customer reviews to find common themes and provide actionable insights for service and product improvements.

## **Tools & Technologies**

- **SQL:** Used for data cleaning, transformation, and extraction from the database.
- **Python:** Employed for advanced analysis, particularly for performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews using Pandas and NLTK (VADER).
- **Power BI:** Utilized for creating an interactive dashboard to visualize the findings and communicate insights effectively.

## **Methodology**

### **1. Data Cleaning and Preparation (SQL)**
Raw data from the `PortfolioProject_MarketingAnalytics` database was cleaned and preprocessed using SQL queries.

Key tasks included:
- **fact_customer_journeys.sql:** Removed duplicate customer journey records and imputed missing Duration values with the daily average.
- **fact_engagement_data.sql:** Standardized the `ContentType` column (e.g., 'Socialmedia' â†’ 'Social Media'), extracted Views and Clicks from a combined column, and filtered out 'Newsletter' data.
- **fact_customer_reviews.sql:** Cleaned the `ReviewText` by removing extra spaces.
- **dim_products.sql & dim_customers.sql:** Created dimension tables for products and customers, including a PriceCategory for products.

### **2. Sentiment Analysis (Python)**
Customer reviews were further analyzed using a Python script in a Jupyter Notebook (`Marketing_analytics_insights.ipynb`):

- The script fetches review data from the SQL database.
- It uses the NLTK VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) library to calculate a compound sentiment score for each review text.
- Based on the sentiment score and the original star rating, a custom function categorizes each review into **Positive, Negative, Mixed Positive, Mixed Negative, or Neutral sentiments**.
- The final DataFrame, including sentiment scores and categories, was exported to `fact_customer_reviews_with_sentiment.csv`.

### **3. Data Visualization (Power BI)**
The processed data was loaded into Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard (`project_goals_and_outcomes.pdf`). This dashboard visualizes KPIs and trends related to the project goals.
